        "body": "I've had a portfolio site before, but it ended up being very complicated and was messy to maintain. This one has been very simple in contrast and coding this has been incredibly fun. I'm an aspiring software engineer currently in college, and I'm constantly looking for something to do in order to keep learning! I've gotten experience in both the frontend and backend sides of development and I'm hoping to get a role as a software engineer to go deep into these technologies",

            "description": "As a Software Engineer Intern, I was put within a team to perform service related tasks. These were all different backend services that I had to learn and adapt to in order to implement the changes needed for my tasks. These changes were related to my team's current epic they were working on. Throughout the internship, I communicated with several different teams and different members of my own team either for training, questions, and advice.",
            "impact": "I was able to complete 3 user stories with increasing complexity. Ranging from database changes to implementing a change on a service for a specific feature. I was also able to learn more about SOA and microservices in general along with the advice learning more about software architecture. Because this was a more team-oriented internship, I also learned more about Agile and Scrum practices. I contributed to different PRs from different teams to learn more about PRs in general, how they function across a large codebase, and to keep other teams' work rolling with feedback. I kept constant communication with my team and my supervisor to make sure the things I did were within their established practices. ",

            "description": "As a software engineer intern, I was tasked with creating a desktop application that would give the user different options to launch another another application with specific configurations. This application is a popular software used by many of the company's customers and provides a way to better streamline user experience. Throughout my internship, I attended regular standups, had weekly meetings with my mentor and supervisor, as well as created documentation outlining my design, approach, and discoveries that would be helpful for anyone picking up the project wherever I left off.",
            "impact":"I created a piece of software that would end up being used for many of the company's customers. Within a few weeks of my internship, I was able to create a prototype and spent the majority of my time at NI implementing features and implemented some UI. I communicated with many different teams across the company and presneting demos to these teams and even the Product Manager for the team I worked with. It was an amazing experience knowing that I started work on software that would end up being used by many people and it was a huge motivator for my work.",

            "description": "This is a project that's following the trend of \"starting small\", which I realized leads to pretty easy development progress. I plan to just make a simple web app where a user can use a kanban board for their projects. Similar to how trello is organized, I plan to just make this a simple app, but there could always be room to add features depending on how fast and easy the project turns out. I've also decided to use Go with Gin as my backend, and so far Go has been an amazing language to work with.",

            "description": "As sort of an ironic idea with the state of the current job market, this project is made as a way for a user to keep track of their job applications. It would be more user managed with them needing to update details on their own, but the aim is to make it much more manageable and easy compared to using something like Excel or Google Sheets. At this point, the project can easily expand to have other features. This project honestly started as a joke but ended up being something that was working well and I stuck with it.",

The reasons included team coordination, discussions, lacking knowledge, etc, but in the end, we were able to get something going. After our presentation and shelving this project, I'm continuously thinking on different ways to improve this project if we ever work on it again. I'm hoping to get far with this project someday.",

Afterwards, I ended up doing tons of research over what sort of thigns you can do with leather craft. In the end, I ended up learning a bit about leather maintenance with conditioners and waxes, as well as transferable skills like sewing in general.",
            "plans": "I haven't had to chance to do much more than a few other kits throughout my college career and leather is pricey, but in the future, I do plan on getting more involved in creating designs and seeing if I can end up selling some of the things I make. For now though, I can't really do much."

            "plans": "One thing I've thought about since I do know programming is maybe creating my own game, but barriers like art (ESPECIALLY ART) takes time to learn and implement and so much more to get down correctly. Music wouldn't be too hard since I've had a big background in music, it would just be a matter of relearning concepts and experimenting."
