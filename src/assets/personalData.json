This application is a popular software used by many of the company's customers and provides a way to better streamline user experience.

It would be more user managed with them needing to update details on their own, but the aim is to make it much more manageable and easy compared to using something like Excel or Google Sheets. At this point, the project can easily expand to have other features.",
