# Welcome!
This is the codebase to my portfolio website! This website runs on GitHub pages and uses React + ChakraUI. I used to have a portfolio website in Svelte but it ended up being extremely complicated (in my opinion) and was not fun in trying to maintain it. This simple setup with React has been extremely simple and quick to build my website
